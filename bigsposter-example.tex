  \maketitle
  \begin{blockrow}
    \blocktitle{This column is called ``block''}
    Use \texttt{bigsposter} as document class, with options \texttt{a2paper}. You can use as well A3, A4, A1, A0, etc. You can use the exact same layout as the old BIGS poster template by specifying the class option \texttt{fixed}. In this mode, all the measures are set with the exact size as it was specified in the original poster template, which means in particular they are hardcoded for \texttt{a2paper}. I kept it for retro-compatibility; by default, all parameters are relative to the paper size to allow scaling. So use either:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \verb|\documentclass[aXpaper]{bigsposter}|
      \item \verb|\documentclass[a2paper, fixed]{bigsposter}|
    \end{itemize}
    \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[2]}
  \blockbreak
    Supports also footnotes in here\blockfootnote{Usually not working properly inside \texttt{framed}, \texttt{multicol}, \textellipsis}.
    You can either break the block manually, or let \LaTeX~auto-balance it\blockfootnote{It uses \texttt{multicolumn} internally.}.

    This block has width \the\blockwidth. Useful for sizing \texttt{minipages} or boxes.\\
    \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[1]}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\blockwidth}
      Can put side-by-side \texttt{minipage}, but it needs to be sized according to the block width. The \texttt{caption} package is locked and loaded.
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\blockwidth}
      \begin{blockfigure}
        \emptybox{0.9\textwidth}{4em}
        \blockcaption[0.9\textwidth]{Supports also figures and captions. Caption width is an optional parameter.}
      \end{blockfigure}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{blockrow}
  \begin{blockrow}[3]
    \blocktitle{This block row\textellipsis}
    Defined commands/environments:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{blockrow}, framed multicolumn environment.
      \item \texttt{blocktitle}, shaded title for a block.
      \item \texttt{blockbreak}, interrupts a block and starts another.
      \item \texttt{blockfootnotemark}, marker only for a footnote. \label{i:marker}
      \item \texttt{blockfootnotetext}, text for the last marker inserted. \label{i:text}
      \item \texttt{blockfootenote}, \ref{i:marker} and \ref{i:text} together.
      \item \texttt{blockfoot}, fills vertical space and inserts year, institute and email.
      \item \texttt{blockfigure}, figure environment within a block.
      \item \texttt{blockcaption}, caption for a \texttt{blockfigure}.
      \item \texttt{blockwidth}, width of a column.
      \item \texttt{advisor}, \texttt{institute}, \texttt{posteryear}, \texttt{email}, \texttt{author}, \texttt{title}: parameters for the title.
      \item \texttt{block}, \texttt{blockrow}, \texttt{blockfootnote}: counters.
    \end{enumerate}
  \blockbreak
    \blocktitle{{\textellipsis}has three\textellipsis}
    \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[4]}
    \blocktitle{Known issues}
    Nothing serious.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{blocktitle} and \texttt{blockbreak} are sensitive to empty lines/newlines before and after them, they do not eat the white space like cool, standard \TeX commands.
      \item \texttt{blockfootnote} does not support custom markers.
      \item \texttt{blockfootnote} requires a forced space using \texttt{\textasciitilde} afterwards.
      \item Wrong vertical spacing around captions and paragraphs when using \texttt{minipage} inside a block.
      \item \texttt{textwidth} does not reflect the column width but the whole, well, text width.
    \end{enumerate}
  \blockbreak
    \blocktitle{{\textellipsis}blocks.}
    \begin{blockfigure}
      \emptybox{0.8\blockwidth}{5em}
      \blockcaption{With some effort, you can make footnotes\blockfootnotemark~work in a caption too.}
    \end{blockfigure}
    \blockfootnotetext{As with usual footnotes, you need to split the mark and the text.}
    \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[6]}
    You can use bibliography directly in here.
