Instructions
------------
1. Download the latest release from the link above or [from here](https://gitlab.com/5p4k/bigsposter/builds/artifacts/master/raw/nightly.tar.gz?job=pdflatex).
2. Decompress the archive `nightly.tar.gz`, it contains the following files:
   - `bigsposter.cls` the file which contains the LaTeX class.
   - `demo.tex`, `demo.pdf` an example poster.
   - `bigsposter.pdf` the complete documentation.
3. Start from `demo.tex`: open the file and adapt it to your needs.

**Note** the only file you really need is `bigsposter.cls`, you can safely delete the others if you feel you don't need documentation or examples.
